# HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition
## Goal
The HR analytics dashboard project aim to track the rate at which employees are leaving the organization. Also, it aim to analyze employee attrition patterns and HR analytics using Excel.It identify factors such as demographics, job satisfaction, compensation, training and career progression contributing to employee churn,and provide actionable insights to reduce employee turnover rate, improve employee retention, and enhance overall organizational performance
## Dataset Information
It contains various attributes such as the employee's age, gender, job role, education, department, and marital status. Other information in the dataset includes the employee's daily rate, monthly income, training history, work experience, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. Additionally, the dataset includes a column for attrition, which indicates whether an employee has left the company or is still employed.
## Data Cleaning
The first step in the project involved data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. This included removing any duplicate entries to avoid potential biases in the dataset. To facilitate better visualization of the data, I created age groups and ranges for monthly income. Furthermore, I verified that there was no missing data and that each field had the correct data type using Filter in Excel (Ctrl T).
